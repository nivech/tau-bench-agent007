# Environment notes

This directory contains notes related to environment management.

- `environment.yml` (located in the repository root) is the curated Conda environment
  specification that all users should use to create or update their environment.

- This directory exists to optionally store environment snapshots or related notes
  in the future (for example, full environment exports for debugging or reproducibility).

Users should normally only need `environment.yml`.
